## Explaining contingency judgments with a computational model of instance-based memory

The purpose of this thesis was to  develop and test an account of human contingency judgments based on a computational model of human memory. Specifically, we used MINERVA 2, a simulation model of episodic memory (Hintzman, 1986). MINERVA 2 is a model of encoding and retrieval. It assumes that individual experiences are encoded as memory traces, and that traces are retrieved as a function of their similarity to an environmental stimulus.  I tested the model by attempting to simulate a study done by Crump, Hannah, Allan, and Hord (2007), that illustrated two major phenomena in the contingency judgment literature, such as the $\triangle$P and outcome density effects. I show that the model can successfully account for both normative contingency judgment behavior and the outcome density bias, and discuss implications for future research.
