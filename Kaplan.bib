  abstract = {The authors previously described a procedure that permits rapid, multiple within-participant evaluations of contingency assessment (the “streamed-trial” procedure, M. J. C. Crump, S. D. Hannah, L. G. Allan, \& L. K. Hord, 2007). In the present experiments, they used the streamed-trial procedure, combined with the method of constant stimuli and a binary classification response, to assess the psychophysics of contingency assessment. This strategy provides a methodology for evaluating whether variations in contingency assessment reflect changes in the participant’s sensitivity to the contingency or changes in the participant’s response bias (or decision criterion). The sign of the contingency (positive or negative), outcome density, and imposition of an explicit payoff structure had little influence on sensitivity to contingencies but did influence the decision criterion. The authors discuss how a psychophysical analysis can provide a better understanding of findings in the literature such as mood and age effects on contingency assessment. They also discuss the relation between a psychophysical approach and an associative account of contingency assessment.},

Memory preserves the events of individual trials in separate traces. A probe presented to memory contacts all traces in parallel and retrieves a weighted sum of the traces, a structure called the echo. Learning of a cue–outcome relationship is measured by the cue’s ability to retrieve a target outcome. The theory predicts a number of associative learning phenomena, including acquisition, extinction, reacquisition, conditioned inhibition, external inhibition, latent inhibition, discrimination, generalization, blocking, overshadowing, overexpectation, superconditioning, re- covery from blocking, recovery from overshadowing, recovery from overexpectation, backward blocking, back- ward conditioned inhibition, and second-order retrospec- tive revaluation. We argue that associative learning is consistent with an instance-based approach to learning and memory.},

The results are broadly consistent with global matching approaches to the computation of the familiarity signal for a musical piece. Further, the results suggest that during the global matching process, the feature-match assessments of separately encoded instances of isolated rhythm and isolated pitch information combine additively across memory traces to increase the familiarity of the test song clip in which they are embedded. As we show through simulations, this additive combination of feature-match levels across memory traces adheres to an assumption present in the MINERVA 2 model of familiarity signal computation.},

This judgment is a conflated measure of the participant’s sensitivity to the cue-outcome relationship, and his or her response bias. A psychophysical model (signal detection theory, SDT) can be used to dissect the independent contributions of sensi- tivity and bias to contingency judgment. Results of an experiment concerning cue-interaction (blocking) illustrate the util- ity of applying SDT to understanding contingency assessment. Most accounts of such assessment are associative (derived primarily from Pavlovian conditioning experiments with non-human animals). A psychophysical analysis of contingency assessment is not an alternative to such associative accounts. The SDT analysis supplements (not replaces) learning prin- ciples with psychophysical principles.},
